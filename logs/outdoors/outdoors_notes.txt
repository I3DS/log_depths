Some tests have been done in the sun logging distances towards
two flat sufaces. One cardboard surface and one black pelican style case
The temperatures of the cameras kept mostly below 50 C.
In some tests the results were clearly good or bad and in others, there 
was so much noise that logs were made to record the results.
